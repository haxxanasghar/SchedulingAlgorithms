# SchedulingAlgorithms
Here is our source code implementation of scheduling algorithms.
# Programming Tool
The simulation tool used in this research work is Workflowsim. It is an extended version of Cloudsim and supports the heterogeneous system overhead and failure. It is mainly used for the execution of workflows that is not possible with Cloudsim.
Our Experiment
In our experimental results, we have executed four algorithms (FCFS, Round Robin, MIN-MIN, and MAX-MIN) in the Workflowsim framework that is the extended version of cloudsim and supports large-scale scheduling. We have used two workflows available in Workflowsim (Montage and CyberShake) [5] and executed them using the algorithms to calculate their makespan by increasing the number of VMs from (5-10). For calculating the makespan, we have used the following formula [5].
